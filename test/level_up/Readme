level_up testing version 1

level_up tracks your code-writing progress, giving you a cheery mesage to the effect
that you have gained a level in a particular language whenever the number of lines of
code in a folder you select passes an arbitrary benchmark.

Dependencies:
    python3
    Tcl/Tk

To test:
    Install py.test, and call it for the proper python version from this directory.
    A message should pop up indicating that you have advanced to level 2 in C, and
    py.test should tell you that none of the unit tests failed.

    If everything works, add your system information to the list below. If not, 
    email Alex at <ahammel87@gmail.com>, or report it to the Red Spider Project
    thread on the xkcd fora <http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=81969>.
