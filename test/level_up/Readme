level_up testing version 1

level_up tracks your code-writing progress, giving you a cheery mesage to the
effect that you have gained a level in a particular language whenever the
number of lines of code in a folder you select passes an arbitrary benchmark.

Dependencies:
    python3
    Tcl/Tk

To test:
    `python3 -m unittest test_level_up.py'

    There are three particular scenarios for testing:
     - You changed the program mechanics of level_up. In this case, clear the
       list below. If the test passes, add your system information.
     - You test on your platform by request (for an example see
       <https://github.com/the-xkcd-community/the-red-spider-project/issues/14>
       ). In this case please report back whether it passes. If it did pass you
       may also add your system information to the list below.
     - You found that level_up didn't work as expected and you wanted to help
       the developer fix it. In this case please report your finding in a new
       issue at
       <https://github.com/the-xkcd-community/the-red-spider-project/issues>.
