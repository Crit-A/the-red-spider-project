[The Red Spider Project](https://github.com/the-xkcd-community/the-red-spider-project)


### Git ###

In order to use Git with this project, you need:

 -  [Git](http://git-scm.com/), and
 -  a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).

[Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) provides a nice and quick
Git tutorial.

**Note**: if you just want to have a copy of the source code and
you're not planning to contribute in any way, you can do without Git
and just download a zip file from the project page.


### Programming languages ###

For now, only [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/) is
required. In order to use the level_up command, you need [Python
3](http://www.python.org/download/) and [Tcl/Tk](http://www.tcl.tk/)
as well. If you want to try the `advbrowser` program, you'll also need
[PHP](http://www.php.net/downloads.php).
