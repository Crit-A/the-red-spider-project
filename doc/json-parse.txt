json-parse (Red Spider Project)

Usage:
    json-parse FIELDNAME

This command takes JSON objects on the standard input and a field name
as its first arguments. It then prints the value of FIELDNAME for each
JSON object to the standard output. It is especially useful when
combined with pipes or file redirects.
