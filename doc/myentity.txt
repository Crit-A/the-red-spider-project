Myentity is a simple Python tool that can translate HTML entity codes
to plain text. To use it from within your own Python code, you can do
something like the following:

    import myentity
    
    s1 = # some string containing HTML entity codes
    s2 = myentity.entityToASCII(s)
    # s2 now contains the same string as s1,
    # but with entity codes replaced by Unicode characters.

The tool can also be called as a standalone program. It will echo text
that it receives on the standard input to the standard output while
replacing HTML entity codes by Unicode characters.
