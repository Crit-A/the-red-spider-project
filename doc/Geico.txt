Geico Help:

To see the comic that this command references go to:
http://www.xkcd.com/42/


The Geico command was created by Rytonbay inc. and was sponsored by
The XKCD Community.

The Geico command was designed so that users can spend more than 15
minutes and save more than 15% on insurance. The Geico command was
designed to help you save money on insurance by helping you pick the
best golf club to threaten your agent with. The Geico command has
already saved people thousands of dollars in insurance.

Rytonbay inc. is not responsible for any results of using the Geico
command including but not limited to; lawsuits, bruises, losing more
money than was gained and your Insurance agent not being your friend
anymore. Be careful when using the Geico command because threatening
people with golf clubs can sometimes lead to lawsuits [citation
needed], which can sometimes be expensive [citation needed].

how does it work?:

 total cost = insurancecost * (1 - (insurance saving percent based on club choice + (strength/100)))
