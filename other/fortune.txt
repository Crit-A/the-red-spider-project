<Aranittara> why did you decide not to make Bucket's database public?
<Randall> A variety of vague reasons.  Letting people duplicate and play with his database makes him less of an entity and more just a collection of channel logs.
<Aranittara> ah
<Aranittara> sure
<Randall> Call me sentimental, but I think it makes it more fun when we anthropomorphize Bucket a bit.
<Aranittara> I understand

<~relsqui> oh oh oh
<~relsqui> I got to use my QR code reader
<~relsqui> there's a paper taped to the window in the front of my school's library, with a code on it!
<~relsqui> and I was like OH HEY I GOT THIS
<~relsqui> pulled out antiphone, scanned code
<~relsqui> it's a text code, not a URL
<~relsqui> it says:
<~relsqui> "Please silence your cell phone."
<~relsqui> well. fucking. played.

< marc> ok story time 
< marc> I either got kicked out of art history class or I have straight as for the rest of the semester without work
< marc> about 30 seconds before class I went up to tell him that I would have to leave a little bit early
< marc> we were talking loud enough so the whole class would hear, but they weren't being very loud anyway, now this guy is an asshole he started the whole high pitched mocking voice and said "well if you're leaving then I guess I'll go too, it's not like I have to teach a class or anything, or you have to be here for it"  
< marc> so I grabbed my keys out of my pocket and tossed them at him, he caught them and I said "well if you're already leaving you can take my mom to chemo"
< marc> whole class goes silent he's just standing there mouth open keys still in his outstretch hand, I walk up take them from his hand said "that's what I thought" and walked out

<@khmer> well folks
<@khmer> my vuvuzelas were a successful tactical deployment

<@khmer> so it's a bunch of software developers, right?
<@khmer> i love em, they're my tribe, but they're a bunch of little boys coddled by a culture that nurtures their every vanity and indulgence in order to milk money out of their high-paying nerd jobs
<@khmer> so they like to shoot nerf guns at each other during the work day
<@khmer> and then mod those nerf guns so that they shoot the little discs so fast they raise welts when they hit me in the face as i'm trying to work
<@khmer> throwing a very sincere fit didn't help
<@khmer> now they just apologize when they hit me on accident
<@khmer> but so, there are a number of us who abstain from nerf death
<@khmer> and playing silly esquivel music whenever a nerf war broke out did not catalyze their awareness of their own silliness
<@khmer> and asking calmly and sincerely did not help
<@khmer> and it just feels wrong to appeal to authority
<@khmer> so i ordered a dozen vuvuzelas from amazon
<@khmer> and passed them out to the noncombatants.
<@khmer> the instructions were
<@khmer> if you or your working area are struck with a nerf disc, blow your vuvuzela
<@khmer> if you hear a vuvuzela being blown, blow your vuvuzela
<@khmer> that was yesterday morning
<@khmer> this morning an email came in from the VP.
<@khmer> and when we arrived at work, the vuvuzelas had been removed from our desks
<@khmer> along with the nerf guns
<@khmer> so as i said
<@khmer> tactical deployment successful
<@khmer> to those vuvuzelas lost in the line of duty, i salute you
<@khmer> bzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

<  logic> Ok, so I was at this party about a week ago, for my friend's birthday
 <  logic> and there was this guy with a deck of cards who'd clearly just learned a magic trick and was doing it to EVERHYONE
 < sudonotplease> logic: A lot of stuff seems to have happened at this party.
 <  logic> And it was pissing me off, so i asked for the deck and springed it a couple of times, fanned it and just fooled around with some false cuts
 <  logic> sudonotplease: it was a good party
 <  logic> And then i gave it back to him
 <  logic> and this girl i had been talking to asked if i did tricks
 <  logic> and figuring the best way to stop any crap magician from doing tricks is to do one better than he could do, I agreed to do just one trick
 < sudonotplease> logic: You magic?
 <  logic> So I let her shuffle the deck, and when she gave it back to me, I just took a quick look at the top card 
 <  Duo> he illusions.
 <  logic> Anyway, it happened to be the Queen of Diamonds
 <  logic> anyone who knows anything about magic knows this is a really easy card to mental-force on girls
 <  logic> So I just asked her what card she was thinking of
 <  logic> And perfectly on cue, she says "Queen of Diamonds" - I turn the card around and amazement occurs
 <  logic> unfortunately, instead of taking this as a trick, she takes it as proof of me being pyschic
 *    sudonotplease knows nothing about magic, but now this!
 <  logic> Anyway - so this girl starts asking me questions, to which I'm saying left right and centre "no, not psychic"
 <  logic> And she just asks me to guess her star sign
 <  logic> I pull Taurus out of the air, which she proclaims to everyone is right
 <  Seth> logic: O.o

< mutable_1alachi> Randall: if I make obscene amounts of money, will you give me immunity from the -signal moderator if I donate $10000 to the charity of your choice?
<&Randall> mutable_1alachi: The charity of my choice?  Man, who's teaching you kids bribery these days?
<&Randall> Whatever happened to handing a guy an envelope full of money?

KBC: Recently, my sister had a child. A few months before hand, she had a baby shower. I was invited, because my sister likes getting presents. I got them Hungry Hungry Hippos. The reason for this? My brother-in-law, when young, was a terror, and his mother was an actual single mother. The father left the day of conception.
KBC: One day, his mother got fed up with my brother-in-laws antics, she said 'That's it, grab one toy, you're going to the orphanage!' So he grabs HHH, they walk around a mall a bit, he's clutching that thing to him saying 'I *sob* Don't *Sob* wanna *sob* go to the orphan*sob*age!'
KBC: And then they go home. But this story isn't about my brother-in-law, or his mother, or even my nephew, really. It's about the baby shower, when I went out to buy their gift- Hungry Hungry Hippos.
KBC: I go to Walmart, because it's the only thing open at the time I went out. I go to the toy section, look at the Lego, crappy excuse for action figures, then grab the game. After that, I start heading for the cash registers.
KBC: On the way towards the cashes, I pass the pharmacy and realize, 'Hey, I need condoms.' Because, well, condoms expire after four years. So, I grab a box of condoms, Tiny Trojans (they invaded in a pony, not a horse) and head to the cashes with my HHH in tow.
KBC: While waiting at the cash, I see their impulse buys. Impulse buy at this cash was gummy bears. This reminded me about a story I heard that eating too many gummy bears can turn your pee black. So I picked up some. For science. (Post-script: It didn't)
KBC: I'm waiting for the cashier, and there's two people in front of me. The cashier is this old, 80 or older blue haired bat who likes talking. She rung the items up for the people in front of me and talked to them for a few minutes, despite their wanting to pay and leave. And then I get served.
KBC: She looks at me and smiles, then looks at my items. Then looks at me. And looks at my items. And then just glares at me. I'm standing right in front of her, after a long 12 hour shift, in a trenchcoat, not having shaved for a week. That's when it hits me, I just won the condom game, where you grab three items, one being condoms, and see if you can get a reaction. You know, coathanger, garbage bags, condoms. Something like that.
KBC: By the way she's looking at me, she must think I'm a child molester. So I say to her. 'Oh, uh, I'm new in town...do you know where I can get a white, panelled van?' And her jaw drops. She scans the items, as she hadn't yet, as fast as fast can be, I give her the money and she pretty much throws it back at me.
KBC: I thank her for her service, and start to leave the store. Before I leave, I look back, and I see her, on the phone, looks like she's yelling, using her hand beside her to try and judge height next to her, probably giving my description to someone. And that's why I'm not allowed at the east end Wal-mart again. END.

<%khmer_at_work> Internet, please meet xkcd.
<%khmer_at_work> He distributes his content for free.
<%khmer_at_work> He writes half of his jokes
<%khmer_at_work> For you programmer folks
<%khmer_at_work> And the other half, he gets from me

<~xkcd> I am shocked by your base allegation
<~xkcd> and declare that it's pure fabrication
<~xkcd> yes, you're often quite clever
<~xkcd> but your jokes are, however,
<~xkcd> insufficient for my publication

<%khmer_at_work> Your rebuttal is cute but transparent.
<%khmer_at_work> Your reliance on me is apparent.
<%khmer_at_work> I'll admit it's pragmatic
<%khmer_at_work> To hide in your attic
<%khmer_at_work> But won't I run into your parents?

<~xkcd> (this limerick game goes for chapters)
<~xkcd> yes, we can become your captors
<~xkcd> you can stay in our attic

<%khmer_at_work> I'll lure them to dream
<%khmer_at_work> With that one 'Lost World' theme
<%khmer_at_work> And then slam their heads in the piano.

<~xkcd> You've devised quite an interesting plan,
<~xkcd> but it'll be over before it began.
<~xkcd> The raptors are smarter;
<~xkcd> your plot's a non-starter.
<~xkcd> Have fun.  I'll be in Kazakhstan.

< Shrdlu> The piano idea could be worse
< Shrdlu> But the details are rather perverse.
< Shrdlu> Smashing their heads
< Shrdlu> Won't ensure that they're dead

<Brooklynxman> full house, I checkmate your ace of spades
<ReishGaluta> My knight chases away your black pawn, and I steal a wood from your hand.
<coaxmetal> Ok, I get 3 wheat and 2 stone this turn, so I roll 3D20's and change the color to Green. Uno.
<paratus> knight to queen's rook seven. touchdown.
<ReishGaluta> Go fish.
* Bucket somehow manages to strangle himself with the fishing wire
<dinosplosion> I see your knight, and raise you a Charizard. CHEAT.

<ReishGaluta> Black Bishop.  Corner Pocket.
<coaxmetal> Rook takes the flag. FINISH HIM.

<vebyast> I'm going to tap my full house for three hearts and two spades, then spend one of the hearts to get out of jail free and the rest to call the top hat in the middle pocket.
<ReishGaluta> cheater
<ReishGaluta> you can't tap a full house for 3 hearts and 2 spades.
<Stereo> not unless you're sitting on a double decker
<Stereo> in the middle of berlin, in 1942
<coaxmetal> Zealot to B3, spends 3 bricks and 2 wheat to spawn Boardwalk Ave. Critical hit.
<ReishGaluta> I thought we were playing under Paris conventions!
<ReishGaluta> that explicitly disallows double-decking, and board-sliding.
* ReishGaluta grabs the Calvinball and goes home.
<Stereo> home may be base, but you can't score that way
<ReishGaluta> depends who's home
<Stereo> anyway, you can board slide if the top hat's in the middle pocket, and you've got a spare sheep
<Stereo> you just have to sacrifice a can of soup to the salvation army
<Stereo> and pray on soulcake tuesday
<coaxmetal> If you bamboozle the Calimari, You can take Marinaris valley without spending any sick leave
* Lorvan uses 2 Venus Djinn to summon Ramses, one of the pyramids is destroyed

<@khmer> SCENE: Mission Control. Apollo 13 is spinning out of control.
<@khmer> <Radio> All right, we've evacuated the command module and we're sealed in the LEM, but the oxygen filter is broken! we need another!
<@khmer> <Mission Commander> All right, Captain, we'll put together a team.
<@khmer> <Mission Commander> Team, here are the supplies they've got. We need to build an air filter for the LEM socket, right now.
<@khmer> <moshez> They shouldn't have gone into the LEM.
<@khmer> <Mission Commander> We're kind of past that, moshez. They've evacuated all the oxygen from the command module.
<@khmer> <moshez> Well it's just the right answer, they shouldn't have gone into the LEM.
<@khmer> <Mission Commander> All right, anyone else? We have to make sure it doesn't take sharp movements, because a good kick could tear right through the aluminum wall.
<@khmer> <moshez> Well, you shouldn't have used aluminum.
<@khmer> <Mission Commander> All right, you know what, dickhole? That's not problem solving. They're in the LEM, the walls are aluminum, and they're in fucking space, so we need to solve this problem!
<@khmer> <moshez> Well, they shouldn't have gone into space. I never need to.
<@khmer> <Mission Commander> What? This isn't about you. This is their situation and their problem and we need to build this air filter!
<@khmer> <moshez> Well don't get mad at me for having the right answers.
<@khmer> <moshez> I just drive to my house and I never have air filtration problems.
<@khmer> <Mission Commander> So, the astronauts have holed up in the LEM and they want us to build an air filter, and your solution is for them not to go into the LEM, not to build it with aluminum, not to go into space, and to drive to your house?
<@khmer> <moshez> You're not thinking about this rationally.

<khmer> as you can imagine, i expect more from my taffy experience, especially when the taffy is prominently advertised as "laffy" above all other characteristics
<khmer> i suggest that you ship me a replacement taffy at once, one whose laffs are more trenchant or, at the very least, more topical
<khmer> otherwise i will report you to the better business bureau and you'll be hearing from a team of lawyers
<khmer> if you don't enjoy the thought of an injunction forcing you to change your name to "Scoffy Toffy" or "Chuckle-Chunks", or, if accuracy is to be maintained, "Shrug-Chews", then i recommend you comply with my request
<khmer> replacement taffys can be mailed to the following address

<@snark> oh man, I completely freaked out my roommate :D
<@snark> we watched paranormal events. And he had already heard that I've run into some stuff a bit like that (most likely just sleep paralysis related hypnogogic stuff). So he is saying "damn it, you better not be bringing any of that here", all half joking
<@snark> anyway, so we go out to grab some food, and we get back to the apartment, we go in through the back door, and as he's finding his keys I surreptitiously ring the doorbell
<@snark> which is very rarely used, and it's an old crappy apartment
<@snark> so he's like "wait, is that our doorbell?" "Uh, I'm not sure." It rings again. "I think that's our doorbell!" He opens the door, it rings again.
<@snark> So he assumes it's coming from the front door, grabs a saucepan from the kitchen, storms over to the front door and opens it
<@snark> of course there's nobody there. We're all looking up and down the street. I decide to ring the front doorbell while he's not looking, just to freak him out a bit more
<@snark> and here's the great bit
<@snark> the front doorbell does not function.
<@snark> So I'm like "Uh... I don't know how it happened, but our doorbell doesn't even work. Look. I'm pressing it repeatedly. I don't know how it rung just now, but it wasn't from someone pressing this button."
<@snark> now he's really pretty freaked out. Not much more is mentioned about it, but we're watching some other movie,  and he'll stop and be like "what is that thing with like the valley of death? That's from the bible, right?" and things of this nature
<@snark> I'm interested to see what further amusement will result in the days to come

khmer: so, i have a bit of a story to tell about last night's party
barnaby: which bit?
khmer: my friends jeff and andrew call me and say, we're hitting up this house party on capitol hill, and i go, fine
khmer: i get there and know nobody; andrew knows the birthday girl, that's about it
khmer: the hosts are a pair of mid-20s IT workers from japan, and 80% of the guest list is japanese exchange students, around my age
khmer: most of them FOB or close, going to various schools in the area
khmer: their english is pretty good but heavily accented and not high on vocabulary
khmer: they're dressed trendy, lots of denim, hair highlights, you get the idea
creature: Does this story end with you seducing someone? 
khmer: swarms of japanese girls, and you know, i just automatically think they probably have relatively innocent schoolgirl sensibilities; too much western entertainment i guess
khmer: but we're out on the balcony smoking and then being openly asked about the size of our dicks
prozac: bwahahahaahahahaha
khmer: 'oh, miyuki and me, we knowww tall boys! hee hee hee!'
zylche: squelch..
khmer: 'i want to stay in seattle parliamentary'
khmer: 'what?'
khmer: 'parliamentary!'
khmer: 'like, forever!'
khmer: 'but it's very hard, you know, visa, and green card'
khmer: 'oh you mean permanently! ah, i see'
khmer: 'yes,' says miho, 'long time, lots of paperwork'
khmer: i nod sympathetically, she says 'or i could marry someone!'
Coldcell: send her over.
khmer: i know, right? but jeff and andrew and i don't flirt overtly, because we're off balance a bit, this has all come as a bit of a surprise, and we're afraid of a huge cultural misunderstanding
Coldcell: khmer, that's a 'bow' not an invite to unzip
prozac: khmer, there was a huge cutural misunderstanding
prozac: japanese arent puritianical like western society.
khmer: like, we were afraid we'd end up in the bedroom, we're like, yes, score, inside-the-park, and she would, i dunno, pull out hungry hungry hippos as we were getting our pants offf
Coldcell: hahaa
khmer: so, yes, considering among other things the cultural gaps you two are pointing out, we made sure not to flirt with anyone heavily
Coldcell: 'oh, I totally play HH in the nude, don't you know Americans?'
khmer: but we definitely get real full of ourselves
khmer: we end up sitting inside in front of like 12 japanese kids, doing stupid elementary school tricks
khmer: like, jeff played the william tell overture with his mouth, i opened a beer can with a lighter
khmer: THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE EVERY TIME
khmer: we recited the who's on first routine
khmer: RIOTOUS LAUGHTER
Ephphatha: opening a beer can with a lighter?
khmer: we could do no wrong! it made me understand why has-been bands go play japan!
khmer: beer bottle, that is
khmer: excuse me
khmer: you know, absence of verbal humor, we're like...
khmer: getting peals of laughter from making shapes with our tongues
khmer: 'look! a tube!'
khmer: so i get a quarter out of my pocket and i grab miyuki, who is heartbreakingly gorgeous
prozac: I'm wondering about how you didn't get laid after all this....
khmer: i press the quarter to my forehead, it sticks there, i hit myself in the back of the head twice, it falls off
khmer: she understands
khmer: so, i press it to her forehead, and, you guys know the trick, right? i remove it as i pull my hand away
khmer: enthusiastically, she begins hitting herself in the back of the head
khmer: one time...two times...three...harder...harder...HARDER
khmer: TWELVE TIMES
khmer: she's getting FURIOUS
khmer: another party guest comes into the room
khmer: she yells something at him in japanese, glares
khmer: he's like...uh...are you...are you sure?
khmer: it's gonna hurt real bad
khmer: she nods frantically
Ephphatha: you're mean
khmer: Ephphatha i was BEGGING her to feel her forehead with her hand
khmer: after like the sixth smack
khmer: she wouldn't LISTEN
khmer: i was FLIPPING THE QUARTER IN MY HAND
khmer: LOOK MIYUKI IT'S THE QUARTER
khmer: MIYUKI STOP THIS
khmer: so she demands that this dude hit her
khmer: and he does
khmer: so hard she FALLS OVER
Ephphatha: hahaha
khmer: gets up, and looks mortified
khmer: she heard no quarter drop
khmer: so i grab her and put her hand on her forehead
khmer: realization breaks out over her face
khmer: her eyes widen, and then
khmer: she JAMS ME INTO A CORNER AND BEATS THE SHIT OUT OF ME
khmer: i'm cowering for my LIFE
khmer: she's screaming and hitting me with closed fists, REALLY HARD
Ephphatha: I'm nearly pissing myself laughing at this
khmer: so, i notice after a few seconds of this
khmer: the blows are falling softer and less often
khmer: she's...she's laughing! ha! all is forgiven!
khmer: the room begins to chuckle, the trance recedes
khmer: then she stops DEAD SILENT
khmer: spins around and GLARES at the guy who hit her really hard
khmer: and BEATS THE FUCK OUT OF HIM
khmer: KICKS, PUNCHES
khmer: he's MOANING FOR MERCY
khmer: her friends have to restrain her
khmer: and then suddenly she BURSTS OUT LAUGHING and laughs for like THREE MINUTES
shoofle: that's a great story
khmer: and then she turns to me and says 'you like jazz?'
creature: Congratulations! You pulled a crazy girl.
khmer: ...the end
prozac: khmer, she'd do wild things to you in the bedroom.
Ephphatha: ok, if I EVER go to a party with you, you're not allowed to have any coins
prozac: Ephphatha, you should give him several
khmer: prozac: i thought about trying to bag her, but...i had a magic:the gathering tournament in the morning
prozac: just dont hit anyone in the back of the head
Coldcell: khmer, you're a living legend

< Spork> So today in the school's parking lot, this big truck was triple parked. So, not being mean enough to actually scratch his truck, I wrote a note that said "Sorry about the scratch" and left it under his wiper. As I was pulling out, he got to his car, looked at the note, and spent like 10 minutes looking for a scratch.

<snark> a man walks into an irc channel
<snark> wait no, he connects to an irc channel
<snark> you cannot physically enter an irc channel
<snark> anyway, so this guy, once he has entered the channel
<snark> hang on did I mention he was hispanic?
<snark> That detail will be important later
<xiaou> no
<snark> it's actually an important part of the punchline in a way
<snark> if you're familiar with hispanic stereotypes
<snark> anyway, where was I
<drazak> snark: actually his irc client connects
<snark> drazak: oh, right, thanks. So this guy who is hispanic has just had his irc client connect to a server, and joined a channel
<snark> I forget the name of the channle but I don't think it ended up being important
<snark> maybe it will come back to me later
<snark> anyway it's a channel in which there are a lot of rednecks, even though that's fairly unusual on the internet in my experience
<snark> I don't know if such a channel actually exists or if it was invented entirely for the purpose of this joke
<snark> I wasn't there, someone else told me it, you see
<snark> so anyway once he has entered this channel, or rather joined it, he orders a beer
<snark> or, wait
<snark> maybe it wasn't an irc channel at all
<snark> was it a biker bar? It might have been a biker bar
<snark> I think I am trying to tell a joke about a hispanic man entering a biker bar probably
<cuddlefish> snark: give up already
<snark> well the thing is though this is where it gets funny
<snark> because the hispanic guy interacts with the bikers in a humourous way
<snark> he might have been mexican. Anyway, the joke ends when one of them says something quite succinct and funny.
<snark> it's a good joke
<DaMullet> snark: Allegedly

<snark> I probably should

<Andrew12> Wouldn't it be ironic if you died in the living room
<_0x44> Is there an expectation that one wouldn't die in a living room?
<Andrew12> ...
<Andrew12> you don't get it
<_0x44> I do indeed.
<_0x44> But irony is the juxtaposition of something with an expected opposite.
<_0x44> So if there is no expectation that one cannot die in a living room, there is no irony.
<_0x44> It would be ironic if a living room were to die, though.

<Scouto2> Actually, Crysis at full settings will destroy your computer.
<Scouto2> Okay, channel: Storytime
<Scouto2> Once upon a time, one of my friends went to the state-run governor school
<Scouto2> He had a friend who had brought a laptop. Now, this poor machine had bad specs, and could barely run Windows XP.
<Scouto2> One day, his friend and him had an idea, a horribly aweful, wonderful idea.
<Scouto2> They would run Crysis at full settings on this ancient machine.
<Scouto2> They installed it onto an external hard drive (the poor machine had not enough space).
<Scouto2> They ran it, and lo and behold, the main menu came up. They turned the settings up to the max.
<Scouto2> They started it in the morning, and it loaded the level all day.
<Scouto2> At 5PM, the level appeared, and they pressed "W" to step forwards.
<Scouto2> It took a half-hour to render that first step, but it was beautiful. It was as if they were witnessing creation itself on that poor machine.
<Scouto2> Then, suddenly, the screen went blank, and a crackle was heard.
<Scouto2> Blue smoke poored out, and the machine died.

<Frowardd> and at the bottom of the screen it scrolls a message, something like "prince george's county is being evacuated blah blah blah" because a great deal of the game goes on in the area around washington DC
<Frowardd> anyway my friend was living in prince george's county

<&snark> This pirate walks into his doctor's office with a steering wheel in his pants and the doctor says "Jim, this is ridiculous. You're over 25 years old and you're pretending to be a fucking pirate."

<Shrdlu> 1.5 cuils. I give you a hamburger.
<&snark> I start screaming only to have special sauce fly from my lips. Across the road a father of three slowly begins to tumble down a staircase.
<Shrdlu> The staircase is made of ennui. The stairs are made of repeated meaningless experiences. The experiences are made of ground beef. Across the road a father of three gives you a hamburger.
<&snark> My eye twitches involuntarily as I reach out for his hamburger. The stairs stretch into yarn as gravity begins to weep silently. You covet gravity, but do not respond. As you give me a hamburger, three children look mournfully upon the staircase. Within every tomato, a thousand years. I try to refuse the hamburger, knowing the price. Endless figures stare from the expansion of a normal number. The beef is going cold. Resolute but repentant, I take a bite of the hamburger.
<&Lingrush> uh
<&snark> You realize that the hamburger is too perfect to be real. It is the idea of a hamburger, and there is only one observer. You are a dream and the burger is the dreamer. You awaken and try to blink the sleep from your pickles. A man tumbles down the staircase towards you. I hand you to the youngest of his children, and begin to weep.

Your teeth progress through an infinite number of buns, searching fruitlessly for the beef and produce. You try to stop, and fail. I give you a hamburger, and within it I give you the universe.
<&snark> The stars are a thousand sesame seeds, and every seed is a hamburger. As I take a second bite, life is born, and a million miles away a child's tear falls upon a stair of ennui. The hamburger is not mocked. As if in response, a distant mooing wakens the dawn of 400 billion suns. I try to return the burger, but you are the burger. The universe is hungry, and I am its mouth.
<Shrdlu> Each seed is the universe, and every planet a hamburger. Across 400 billion planets, the sun rises in unison. The universe is hungry. The mouth forms words. You ask for a hamburger. I give you a hamburger.

< A42> my problem is
< A42> I downloaded some pleasantly sounding tunes, and wanted to put them on my MP3 player.
< A42> However, when I put the MP3 USB thing in the computer...
< A42> ERROR: POWER SURGE. I HATE YOU. RESET DRIVE. BZZZZ.
< A42> As in, the USB has a power surge.
<@Shrdlu> A42: Yeah, see, that'll happen when your sprocket emitter clogs.  You've got dehydrogenated plasma all through the ventral joists.  You'll need to get in there with a long-nozzled frobnicator and clear out the valves by hand.
< A42> okay how do i open the vental joists?
< A42> where are they?
< A42> where do i get a long nozzle frobnicator?
<@Shrdlu> A42: They're all along the underside of the primary containment manifold, just like the name implies.
<@Shrdlu> A42: As for the frobnicator, try a hardware store -- if they don't have one in stock, they may be able to order it for you.
< A42> okay i think i know what your talking about its the metal box right
< spaghettifier> Shrdlu: he'll get killed without the proper protection
< A42> OW the primary containment thing shocked me
< spaghettifier> A42: remember gloves.
<@Shrdlu> A42: Make sure to buy brand-name.  It's a little more expensive, but I had a bad experience with a faulty frobnicator once.  I ended up getting supercooled interociter fuel all through the joists, and I eventually had to scrap the whole unit.
< A42> wait
< A42> i just did a google image search for this stuff
< A42> you liar
<@Shrdlu> A42: Yeah, your MP3 player's probably defective.  If the USB port works with some other device, you'll want to return the player to the manufacturer if it's still under warranty.

<@khmer> res0: so it just happened to spend three movies in pizza mode
<@res0> no, it was always a pizza
<@res0> it's not a heavy freighter... so it was designed to hold like 50 pallets of fresh produce or something
<@khmer> res0: in a deleted scene, solo and chewie are arguing over whether the "cupcake hull" or the "ficus greenhouse hull" would present a better defensive profile
<@sheepbat> the VW Beetle hull is fantastic for beating thorndyke in a rake though
<@khmer> also what was the purpose of the death star?
<@sheepbat> the death star was actually a massive AT&T call center
<@khmer> yeah that makes sense
<@khmer> i thought the whole point of the deathstar was the laser thing, right?
<@khmer> so when the second one is like half done but the laser is already online
<@sheepbat> the main weapon was just a badly tuned collect call

<@relsqui> barometz: so randall did this talk at google
* Fusilliban sits back, grabs popcorn from bucket.
<@relsqui> about the comic and his background and stuff
<@relsqui> some sketches
<@relsqui> they come around to the QA
<@relsqui> older gentleman in the front row stands up and says, okay, so what's Elaine's O(n log(log n)) algorithm? (http://xkcd.com/342/)
<@relsqui> so there's a laugh, at the question
<@relsqui> and randy is like "well you'd have to ask elaine" which is a decent way to handle it
<@relsqui> and then someone asks him "did you notice who that was asking you that question?"
<@relsqui> anyone wanna guess?
<x2x> No.  Please tell me it wasn't Don Knuth.
<@relsqui> it was Donald Knuth
<anaximander> it was
<x2x> Sheeeeeeeeit.
<@relsqui> the talk was arranged kind of last-minute so they couldn't get a big enough hall for the interest
<@relsqui> (because, lol, you think there are some xkcd nerds at google?)
<@relsqui> so they set up satellite rooms with a video feed
<@relsqui> and a site where people could send in questions to the main projector
<@relsqui> randy reads a couple off there
<@relsqui> the first one iirc is "so I've been using Python for a while, when can I expect to be able to fly?"
<@relsqui> (http://xkcd.com/353/)
<@relsqui> which again, gets a laugh
<@relsqui> iirc the answer was "hey man just import antigravity it should work"
<@relsqui> and, again--after the talk was over, this time--someone taps randall on the shoulder
<@relsqui> "so you couldn't tell 'cause he was in a satellite room, but do you know who asked that one?"
<x2x> Guido van Rossum?
<@relsqui> naturally.
<@relsqui> so yeah. he came along on our tour and explained to randy why python join syntax is weird

<Seth> I wonder what they're gonna do with the mine chamber afterwards.
<lander> They could turn it into a hipster club.  It would be SO underground.

<wjw75> I really like Obscure Album by Band You've Never Heard Of, because it gives me a feeling of smug superiority whilst allowing me to express my unique individualism.
<jmmcd> Yes but Earlier Stuff by the same band is far better.
<ABabyAteMyDingo> You should hear Solo Album the lead singer made under the name Pseudonym.
<buddhahat> What you really want (but can't get) is the Impossibly Hard to Come By vinyl only recording of The Concert Only 3 People Knew About.
<munificent> I was at that concert. The recording doesn't hold a candle to the live experience.
<postdarwin> Yeah, but the sound in the hall was crap. 
<postdarwin> I was backstage at The Concert Only 3 People Knew About by Lead Singer (which was eventually released as Impossibly Hard To Come by vinyl) and I captured the unmastered output from the monitor mix desk. 
<postdarwin> This was by far the best performance by any band ever. Unfortunately, I can't remember what I named the file--something like CTX000118.wav I think.
<vkkim> Heh, I used to sell their drummer coke and I kept /my/ recording. I'll trade you the FLACs for Lead Singer's experimental work he did in college while tripping on acid. 
<vkkim> That shit is so raw, you can't even tell it's music. 
<vkkim> Rumor has it that he didn't even plan on recording it, but left his 4-track recorder on accidentally while having sex. He even got the last of the Dying Lizards in on it too. Crazy.
<bitt3n> I am Lead Singer and I don't know what the hell you wankers are talking about.  I ripped all my riffs off of Boy George albums transcribed into 3/4 time. 
<bitt3n> Hell, my most famous song, College Radio Sensation, is just "Karma Chameleon" played at 33 RPM.
<cedarzero> Dear Lead Singer, I am writing to say that rips of your band's first three 45's showed up recently in my feeds, and I listened to them without historical or cultural baggage. 
<cedarzero> I found them enjoyable, and I think it's a shame they're out of print. It's good work.
<cedarzero> Best, Amateur Musicologist
<infosnax> But did you get there in time to see Opening Band, who served as a real inspiration for all of BYNHO's work? I did. 
<infosnax> I'm pretty sure I was the only one there.
<munificent> I caught them playing acoustic in the back yard at the after party when Local Legend Who Split Up Just Before Getting Huge showed up and jammed with them.
<jmmcd> Only us true fans refer to them as BYNHO. High-five!
<Chthonius> True fans know that they changed the spelling to B!YNHO from BYNHO! to distinguish themselves from the Japanese movie of the same name.
<memsisthefuture> Man, Opening Band is such a ripoff. They stole most of their material from Dull Smoked Up 70's Band, and what they didn't steal just sucks.
<petdance> I call bullshit. If you were an actual hipster you would have said "show," not "concert."
<runeinalya> Solo Album wasn't really all that great. Lead Singer's old band was so much better on their first demo recording in their attic when they were all in middle school.
<kirun> Dude, they totally sold out when they released Next Album on Label That Once Signed Popular Artist.
<ibsulon> Dude, that was such an underrated album! Everyone hated it just because it was on a major label and had commercial production values. If the True Fans (TM) would have supported it, they wouldn't have broken up and who knows what they would have come up with next?
<-J-> Well their last album title '"True /Fans/ (TM)"' was kind of sarcastic and is known as their "fare bad" album rather than their fare well. 
<-J-> Kind of a slap in the face if you ask me.
<-J-> With songs like "It Was All Your Fault You Lazy Bastards", and "You're So Dumb (I Bet You Don't Even Know What This Song Means)" to the tune of Carly Simons' "You're So Vein", and "Did You Ever Even Hear Of Us?", how could one not feel a little bit put off by their gratitude to their real
fans who you've never heard of?
<blankaccount> I really liked Less Obscure 'Pop Outsiders' That Are Worse than Band You've Never Heard Of But Which Allow Me to Maintain Superiority Even Above them by Complying With Certain Conformities.
<schneby> I like Comeback 80's Band with New Lead Singer Guy.
<memsisthefuture> Pssh! Come on, gimme a break. They are ruining their good reputation. New Lead Singer Guy isn't even half the man Heroin Overdose Dude was.
<toastspork> Oh, them.
<toastspork> Yeah, I knew them before anyone knew who they were. Even before *they* knew who they were.
<clearwaterlab> I liked their older stuff, especially the album recorded in a jail cell. That's RAW.
<shootdashit> why won't anyone mention this band's name you're all talking about?! it sounds fuckin' awesome.

<Potassium> http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/4131459/Audience-faints-at-amputation-film - Man, I remember hearing about that. That guy is so fucking badass

<Xeio> I don't get the "It's rude to speak ill of the dead" thing. Did people suddenly stop hating on Hitler while I wasn't looking? :P

<Shrdlu> somewhere after that is the one with an appendix explaining that the poor typographical quality is due to injuries sustained on the job and begging the reader's understanding

< puddle> I looked down at a thundercloud from the open door of a Lavochkin La-9 fighter jet
< puddle> There was one backpack left, and if I didn't fight for it, the Soviet spy would get to it first

< puddle> The pilot was headed toward Leningrad, and for the sake of the nation I couldn't let that happen
< puddle> He grabbed me by the neck, but I gave him several good blows to the head
< puddle> I tumbled in a daze out the side door as the plane entered a tailspin, my parachute working, I had successfully escaped with the nuclear reactor documents and breathed a sigh of relief
< puddle> and promptly fell into the whirling blades of a nearby helicopter; but I was strong-willed, my collective consciousness lived on, my grizzled remains were struck by lightning from the thundercloud I fell through
< puddle> and then I fell to the ground as...puddle.

<PacifistDalek> So, #xkcd, are you guys pro-pun or anti-pun? Because if you're pro-pun, I have a story to tell
<hexium> PacifistDalek: we believe a good pun is its own reword
<PacifistDalek> hexium: awesome.
<PacifistDalek> Well, a buddy of mine told me this (true) story.
<PacifistDalek> This guy is one of the greatest/worst pun-makers I've ever met
<PacifistDalek> he can just come up with them off the top of his head over and over again
<PacifistDalek> We (my friends and I) tend to just groan and throw whatever we have in reach at him whenever he puns
<PacifistDalek> But anyways
<PacifistDalek> he was visiting his girlfriend
<PacifistDalek> and they went on a walk near her old high school
<PacifistDalek> her high school had a big gong-bell-thing that was rung whenever something did someone awesome, like score a goal in a school sports games or whatever
<PacifistDalek> she had only rung it a handful of times back when she was in high school
<PacifistDalek> (her school had reprimanded anyone who had rung it when it wasn't warranted)
<PacifistDalek> So she decided to ring it then...and she did so...
<PacifistDalek> Then my friend turned to her and said "You ring a bell, and now I will give my belle a ring"
<PacifistDalek> And that's how my pun-loving friend used a pun to propose to his girlfriend
<PacifistDalek> (she said yes)
<PacifistDalek> *fin*

<Velociraptors> The average Australian eats over six gigatonnes of cane sugar per year.
<Eule> that seems high, given the density of sugar, and average intake and output orifice sizes
<Diet-Drew> that seems about right
<fermentedGoat> Thats ludisucrose
<Eule> okay, assuming metric tons, 6 gigatons is 6,000,000,000,000 kg
<Eule> that says that one person eats an average of 1,640,000,000 kg of food a day
<Eule> something is off by several orders of magnitude
<Shrdlu> Eule: This is correct, and is an example of why the arithmetic mean is often the wrong choice.
<Shrdlu> Eule: Because most of us humans eat much, much less than that.

<Antimony-120> So, my girlfriend's mother is in town for (Canadian) thanksgiving
<Antimony-120> Now, the rule is that she (the mother) doesn't mind the fact that her daughter (my gf) is getting laid, so long as it isn't while she (the mother) is in the building. Same with all her children apparently, it just weirds her out.
<Antimony-120> So Saturday night we (the gf and I) are watching a movie in her room. And we start making out. After awhile the gf says "Hey, it's my house. As long as we're quiet..."
<Antimony-120> Like magic the mother pops by and asks about what wine she should pick up at the store, makes a crack about "Just remember, no unf unf with the mum around".
<Antimony-120> Keep in mind this is literally SECONDS after
<Palomides> she has the room bugged
<Antimony-120> But hey, the mother is going out, so we start going and are getting along. Then, footsteps on the stairs, we dive under the covers and pretend we were watching a movie
<Antimony-120> it was the best we could come up with at the time
<Antimony-120> she walks in "Forgot my car keys"
<Antimony-120> turns, walks halfway out, and sees my underwear on the dresser
<Antimony-120> walks over, PICKS THEM UP, says "Well, at least there's no skidmarks, have fun", and walks out.
<Palomides> :|
<Antimony-120> Next day at breakfast, somewhat awkward conversation, then she says: "Oh, and remind me never to let you two watch a movie while I'm around, that was close"
<Antimony-120> the gf is somewhat annoyed with her mother about this (it being the gf's house she feels she can do whatever she wants, which I can appreciate)
<Antimony-120> says: "Close? How do you know we weren't going at it like rabbits!"
<Antimony-120> the mother, doesn't even look up, "honey, if he can keep it up while thinking about skidmarks you have more serious issues to worry about"
<Antimony-120> in conclusion: Well played madam, well played
<Boom_Farmer> Antimony-120: That is amazing.
<Antimony-120> oh, and for future reference, she was right. the skidmarks thing completely killed the mood
<Palomides> as opposed to the simple fact of her showing up? :P
<Antimony-120> well we probably could have gotten back into the mood after being interuppted
<Antimony-120> it was just the sheer "...wtf?" factor threw us for a loop
<Debaser> Antimony-120: :O
<Debaser> Bloody hell
<Antimony-120> Debaser: I know, it was slightly worrisome
<Debaser> Nice move with the skidmarks, though

< Quadropus> zylche: you were lucky to have a poison ivy branch! all we had was a tub of hydrocholoric acid and a sponge made of gravel. and after that, we would brush out hair with used needles!
< zylche> That's nothing! Afterwards we had to use lye as talcum powder then wash our mouth out with liquid uranium!
< Heinreich> zylche, BUT ITS WHAT WE HAD, AND WE WERE DAMN THANKFUL, amirite?
< Heinreich> Hell, you had MOUTHS?
< Heinreich> ALl we had were esophagal tears!
< Heinreich> We had to mash our food up real good before we literally shoved it down our throats.
< zylche> Damn thankful? We spent the rest of the day and night thanking all of our relatives for being able to use it! Then we had a second of sleep on a bed of hyperdermic syringes with a blanket full of sars. AND WE WERE DAMN THANKFUL FOR IT!
< RogueNine> You had a blanket of sars?  Ahh, you youngersters dont know how good you have it
< RogueNine> I slept in the gullet of a dinosaur!
< zylche> That's nothing, I had to sleep with Cthulhu!
< zylche> He hogs all the covers.
< Quadropus> zylche: liquid uranium? you should be thankful for that! every morning we had to get up at 4 am, wash out hair with monkey semen and prepare for a day of beatings from my mace wielding father only to be sent out into the local black hole to fetch our dinner of light.. if we were lucky we would get a helping of dust...
< ^O_o^> SARSly
< Heinreich> YOU HAD DINOSAURS? All we had were the enormous festering sores of our most highest ruler of darkness, Cthulhu.
< zylche> LIGHT?! We were lucky to get a quark a YEAR!

<@mewyn> Woah.  I just street viewed into a store
<@relsqui> mewyn: I would've liked to be there when the gmaps car drove into it
< tntc> relsqui: ok, that was a joke, and a funny one at that, but lets take a look at what they ACTUALLY WALKED INTO THE FUCKING STORE WITH:
< tntc> http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/06/google-reveals-an-image-capturing-backpack-and-new-3d-maps/
< tntc> Can you imagine that shit rolling into your store?
< tntc> "Hi! I'm here with like 20 cameras in a giant penis!"
<@relsqui> "excuse me sir, you're going to need to check your bag"
< tntc> "Fuck you. If I steal anything, you'll know on google fucking maps."

<Ariamis> So I have about half a Discworld library and I feel like reading one this evening. Whichever I choose will be for the fourth or so time. Recommendations, anyone?
<schwal> The Truth
<Bucket> You can't handle the truth!
<schwal> Or not.

<dinosplosion> P or not P, that is the question
<khmer> whether 'tis simpler in the problem space to suffer the slings and vectors of outrageous computation time
<Spi_Waterwing> or to take algorithms against a sea of problems
<khmer> or to take arms against a sea of solutions, and by verifying, compute them
<khmer> Spi_Waterwing: algorithms is better
<Spi_Waterwing> khmer: and by verifying, solve them
<khmer> to derive, to sweep
<Spi_Waterwing> to sweep, perchance to clean?
<Spi_Waterwing>naw
<Spi_Waterwing> And in that sweep of garbage collection, what pointers may come
<Spi_Waterwing> when we have removed all unassigned values
<Spi_Waterwing> (I'm just making sh!t up at this point)
<khmer>must give us protection faults
<Spi_Waterwing> (oh, I skipped some lines)
<Spi_Waterwing> to derive, to sweep / No more: and by a sweep to say we remove / the unused references, and the thousand dirty pointers / that memory is heir to; tis an efficiency improvement / devoutly to be wished
<rpenguin> these are the stories khmer recites quietly into the channel which slip from client to client like a sparrow.

<ZettaWatt> Only to your surprise, you find your mother and your dinner having sex on your dining table.
<Wonderfish> No. I found me and your mother having sex while the bacon watches, blushing.

<     logic> I went to the supermarket earlier and there was this guy standing next to a little newspaper stand which boldly proclaimed "These newspapers are FREE!" in big red letters. And he had a small sign saying "These newspapers are free, why isn't Tibet?".
<     logic> I gave him a high five.

<Elyscape> also, have you considered the possibility that individuals who don't produce offspring might actually be an evolutionary benefit?
<Elyscape> because they're not spending their efforts on finding a mate, they do other things.
<Elyscape> which may ultimately help other individuals survive or produce viable offspring or whatever
<Eule> it is a little known fact that many gay and lesbian people voluntarily patrol their neighborhoods and fight off velociraptor attacks
<Elyscape> Eule: I'm only alive because of the neighborhood lesbian.

< Saturn> had a bit of a river tam moment just now
< Saturn> my mum was making us some sandwiches, and she had two piles of bread
< Saturn> she took one pile, and put it on the other
< Saturn> so i said "it's a stack"
< Saturn> she looked at me and said "what?"
< Saturn> i pointed to the bread, "it's a stack!"
< Saturn> she gives me that sympathetic look that mothers give, "yes dear, it is"
< Saturn> "you pushed 2 pieces of bread onto the stack", i say
< Saturn> "what?"
< Saturn> "if you have another stack", i put my hand out, "you can pop from that stack onto the second stack," start transferring bread to a pile in my hand, "and they'll be in reverse order"
< Saturn> "what are you doing?"
< Saturn> bread is now in reverse order on my hand
< Saturn> "see! reverse!"
< Saturn> and i put the bread back on the plate
< Saturn> i then start wandering off into the living room, then call back to her "of course, it's more interesting if it's numbers!"
< Saturn> "what?", she calls to me, so i go back into the kitchen and said, "it's more interesting if the bread is numbers"
< Saturn> so she gives me the 'you are absolutely crazy' look, and says "i don't know if what you just said is something very clever, or somethign very stupid, but i'm damned if i'm letting you carve the turkey this christmas"
< barometz> "look! slices!"

<noamsml> "A hundred prisoners are each locked in a room with three pirates, one of whom will walk the plank in the morning. Each prisoner has 10 bottles of wine, one of which has been poisoned; and each pirate has 12 coins, one of which is counterfeit and weighs either more or less than a genuine coin. In the room is a single switch, which the prisoner may either leave as it is, or flip. Before being led into the rooms, the prisoners are all made to
<noamsml> wear either a red hat or a blue hat; they can see all the other prisoners' hats, but not their own. Meanwhile, a six-digit prime number of monkeys multiply until their digits reverse, then all have to get across a river using a canoe that can hold at most two monkeys at a time. But half the monkeys always lie and the other half always tell the truth. Given that the Nth prisoner knows that one of the monkeys doesn't know that a pirate doesn't
<noamsml>  know the product of two numbers between 1 and 100 without knowing that the N+1th prisoner has flipped the switch in his room or not after having determined which bottle of wine was poisoned and what colour his hat is, what is the solution to this puzzle?"

<@khmer> Randall: i decided to adopt the opposite tactic from last year, and mention my birthday awkwardly and demandingly at every opportunity
< paparatti> khmer, it's your birthday?

<&Randall> there once was a man named khmer
<&Randall> for his birthday, I bought him a chair
<&Randall> he said "what's this shit?"
<&Randall> I said "right there -- sit."
<&Randall> it's a throne; you're the prince of Bel-Air.

<@khmer> I celebrate birthdays in meter
<@khmer> and i know no tradition that's leeter
<@khmer> and when Randall engages
<@khmer> I know of no wages
<@khmer> That would make a friendship much sweeter.

<&Randall> for so clever a wit is khmer
<&Randall> in poetic games, I despair
<&Randall> yes, he leaves me behind,
<&Randall> but the view, I don't mind,
<&Randall> since he has such a cute derriere

<@khmer> i've had birthdays with bees, bruises, rain
<@khmer> some have orgies, suites, or cocaine
<@khmer> but i dance with such glee
<@khmer> to be on IRC
<@khmer> so that Randall can give me some brain

<&Randall> khmer, I just parsed what you've said
<&Randall> and you're synonymally misled
<&Randall> you ask me for brain
<&Randall> but I'll have to refrain
<&Randall> since I think what you meant there was "head"

<@khmer> Randall: thanks so much for your clarification
<@khmer> malaprops can cause such consternation!

<Kieran> I need superglue
<Kieran> So I can at least get it somewhat in
<Lisimba> You need lube for that, not glue.
<Kieran> lol
<Kieran> No, it wont fit inside anymore
<Kieran> It mostly goes in
<Kieran> but a little bit doesnt
<Kieran> and it falls out
<Kieran> :(
* Lisimba falls over laughing
<freelancer> ...do I want to know what you're talking about? =/
<Kieran> A metal ring that goes around my k-slot? O_o
<Lisimba> Yeah. Context is everything.
<Lisimba> But before you stick glue in your slot, work out *why* it's not fitting anymore.
<Kieran> I dunno :(
<Lisimba> Well, stick it in, see where it stops, then work out what stops it.
<Lisimba> Basic trouble shooting.
<Lisimba> Sticking it in halfway and then glueing it there is... ick.
<freelancer> Yeah, this conversation really needs context XD
<Kieran> I cant see inside when I'm sticking it in
<Lisimba> Use a magnifier or something.
<Kieran> no, it obscures it
<Kieran> you cant see inside when you push it to where it cant go in
<Lisimba> ...no, look inside when it's not in there.
<Kieran> I see the lights, the lot slot that goes through the center of the ring, and a little bit of metal foil
<Lisimba> Maybe the foil got bent and is in the way or something.
<Lisimba> That's what you got to work out.
<Kieran> it's not that solid
<Kieran> when I push it in, one side sticks in and the other sticks out
<Kieran> I cant push both sides in at the same time
<katiedid> o.0
<Lisimba> See where it pivots.

<Lisimba> Where it pivots is where it's stuck, generally.
<Kieran> Katie, what?
<katiedid> This conversation keeps getting better
<katiedid> Sorry, I think dirty, dirty thoughts
<Lisimba> Kieran: just about everything you said so far sounds really funny when taken out of context.
<Lisimba> katiedid: you're a dirty, dirty woman.
<Kieran> the part that goes through the hole
<Lisimba> hahahaha
<katiedid> s/woman/girly
<Kieran> it's not going through all the way or something
<katiedid> ...
<freelancer> This conversation is awesome -_-
<Lisimba> Kieran: have you tried pushing gentrly?
<Lisimba> *gently?
<Lisimba> Maybe you *do* need lube.
<Kieran> lol
<Kieran> it's like
<Kieran> the part were it gets thicker
<Kieran> doesnt fit in the hole
<Kieran> but the thin part does
<Nek> ...
<Nek> I clearly need to scroll upwards.
<Nek> I hope.
<Lisimba> Maybe it's deformed.
<Kieran> It doesnt look deformed
<Kieran> it just looks too thick
<Kieran> I dont know how they stuck it through there in the first place
<Lisimba> It fit in before, it came out, so it went through twice already.
<katiedid> It should go in again
<katiedid> And again
<freelancer> Katie has lots of experience with this.
<katiedid> It's okay to try and force it
<Kieran> I just dont know why it wont fit :(
<Lisimba> So figure it out.
<katiedid> Make it fit
<Kieran> it's not that easy
<katiedid> One word
<katiedid> PICS
<Lisimba> Yeah. Pics of katie.
<Kieran> I dont have a camera, so I cant take a pic of the place were it goes in
<Kieran> but I have a webcam, so I can take a picture of the hole
<freelancer> I'm not sure I want a picture of your hole... >_>
<katiedid> You should probably take a picture of trying to force the thick thing into the tiny hole
<katiedid> .... I'm horrible -_-

< bloopletech> So, when I was 10, we got a duckling
< bloopletech> it was the coolest thing ever
< bloopletech> all the time I was home I hung around with it
< bloopletech> It slept in my bed sometimes too
< bloopletech> So, one day I was in the bath
< bloopletech> and we decided to give the duckling a bath at the same time
< bloopletech> And, it saw a big fat juicy worm
< bloopletech> And bit me on the penis
< bloopletech> I was not amused
< bloopletech> We called the local doctor and went in
< bloopletech> Can you even IMAGINE explaining that to a doctor
< bloopletech> He could barely stop himself from laughing
< bloopletech> He said I'd be fine

<@Shrdlu> About a man who was writing a short story and killed off a character.

<@Shrdlu> For obvious reasons, I didn't actually write this thing.

<+Sydney> ...so a girl on my floor is drunk and crying because her shoes are locked on and someone stole the key.
<+pseudonym1> her shoes are locked on?
<+pseudonym1> she can't take them off without a key?
<+Sydney> You correctly identify the problem.
<+Sydney> The key, meanwhile, is missing.  We can only hope it's recoverable, instead of flushed or stolen.
<+JustWhie> Pick the lock? Consider it a humorous bonding experience?
<+Sydney> JustWhie:  I never learned how to do that.
<+Tiggum> What sort of shoes are lockable anyway?
<+curtmack> Tiggum: Maybe it's like a chastity belt for a feet?
<+curtmack> You never know what kind of weirdos are out there.
<+JustWhie> If they aren't skates, I picture them as shoes that are very tall. The lock would be on the side of the ankle/leg part. But its only my imagination talking.
<+JustWhie> How unique are these keys? If its the same one for every pair, she can wait awhile and buy a replacement.
<+JustWhie> replacement key, not shoe. They must account for these things. One would think.
<+Sydney> This is a UNIVERSITY.  She has to get around campus in those for...until she can go back to wherever she bought the shoes.
<+Sydney> Which is halfway across Canada, laterally.
<+Tiggum> If it's like those diary locks then a half-decent sneeze should be enough to knock it open.
<+shenron> why must she wear lockable shoes
<+Sydney> She's drunk enough not to be able to stay on-topic long enough to speak to it, but we think they're bondage shoes.  We think this because the locks are proving rather sturdy.
<+Tiggum> Just get something vaguely keylike that's small enough to fit in the lock and jiggle it. (I'm not explaining that very well, but those locks are really really crap, so no actual skill is required)
<+Sydney> The Engineering majors have already shut themselves up in someone's room, and are trying to figure something out.
<+JustWhie> That's the kind of stuff we like to hear.
<+Sydney> Tiggum - We've tried that too.  One, the fool won't hold still, and two, the only people who have even the modicum of ability needed for that are shut up in that room.
<+pseudonym> can she draw/explain what the cross section of the key looked like?
<+Sydney> Now, she's drunk enough that she thinks she'll just put up with it. We think that tomorrow morning, she'll discover the rational failing.
<+Sydney> Once she sobers up and stops quoting the Portal turrets, we'll ask her to try.
<+Sydney> ...I just went and listened at the door of the Engineering majors.
<+Sydney> They are arguing about snowball fights.
<+pseudonym> Sydney: put them back to work
<+Sydney> I tried.  All that happened was one of them shouted "Tell Rob that it's cheating to use a goddamn snowblower!"  "You don't know shit, Evan, it's called superior firepower!"
<+pseudonym> just tell them that they can't do it. challenge their engineering skills
<+Sydney> Very well.  A moment.
<+curtmack> Sydney: It would be advised that you then get out of their way after saying this, else they'll be wiping bits of you off of their chins.
<+Sydney> ..."That's what we're doing.  The snowball discussion is an analogy we're using to define our operational philosophy."
<+Sydney> "The snowblower faction want to find a way to compromise the lock itself; the anti-snowblower faction want to find a way to fake a key without any information about it."
<+pseudonym> what about the faction that wants to use plastic explosives to blow the locks?
<+JustWhie> That, though it doesn't sound like it, is a compromise.
<+pseudonym> or are you still going for a non-destructive solution?
<+Sydney> "The analogy was supposed to speak to a definition of which way around would require more skill, but now we're all upset with each other."
<+Sydney> I asked them how long it'll take before the sharks arrive. None got it.
<+Sydney> pseudonym - I'm sure that if we had Semtex, they'd have employed it by now.
<+pseudonym> bah, what kind of engineers don't stock explosives?
<+Sydney> What the hell?  The drunkest of them just ran out with bolt cutters and is trying to convince us that chopping the heels off will help.
<+pseudonym> Sydney: any progress on the locks?
<+Sydney> No.  The engineers got thoroughly sidetracked, one punched another, the girl went to bed, and we're going to figure this out tomorrow when she sobers up and gets desperate.
<+Sydney> Although I reckon she'll be up in a few hours because her feet hurt and she can't sleep.

<Cheez> plus exit polls would be mostly refused by people, we do not like to talk about who we voted for

<InitHello> Cheez: "I voted for none of your goddamn business, of the fuck off party."
<puddle> "they seem to be doing awfully well this year, sir, thank you for your response"

<Aberro> My bio teacher called Carl Sagan boring today.
<Aberro> I literally shouted "fuck you" at her
<Aberro> She sorta stared at me shocked, and then told me not to say that again.
<Shrdlu> Just like Sagan would've done!
<Aberro> I KNOW RIGHT?
<Shrdlu> Sagan was all about using sharp invective to combat ignorance.
<Shrdlu> It was basically his bread and butter. Honestly I think towards the end he got a little repetitive -- too heavy on "fuck," light on the more creative interjections.
<Shrdlu> But I guess now that he's gone, it's our duty to carry on his legacy by cussing out the people who don't understand things.
<Selig> FUCK YOU AND YOUR NONUNDERSTANDING OF BLACK HOLE THEORY
<Selig> RAWR RAWR RAWR
<Shrdlu> "Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. How the fuck are you not getting this? Jesus."
<Aberro> Carl Sagan is definitely my hero.

<Bucket> What *do* they teach in schools these days?

<burtonlang>	So I know there's some book that at some point presents a society of people who have no language, instead carrying around any objects they might need to "talk" about and presenting them as appropriate. Anybody know what book that is?
<burtonlang>	Or who the author is?
<burtonlang>	It feels Gulliver's Travels-y, but I'm not sure.
<goost73>	burtonlang: "The Complete Guide to Powerpoint"

<@khmer> the new foreman is being shown around the gigantic underground warehouse by his brother, the freight elevator operator, who got him the job. they pass by the refrigeration unit as the elevator is descending the many floors to the bottom of the warehouse, and a blast of frigid air hits them both. 
<@khmer> the foreman knows he is underqualified and fundamentally irresponsible, and his substance abuse problem has lost him plenty of jobs, but his brother wanted to give him another chance
<@khmer> the foreman feels the blast of cool air like the breath of a watchful god, poised to smite him should he betray his kin another time
<@khmer> "what was that blast of air", he says gingerly to his stoic brother
<@khmer> his brother says "that's the refrigeration unit, on the 4th floor."
<@khmer> a long and uncomfortable silence passes between the two brothers
<@khmer> both of them feeling the weight of expectation upon their shoulders
<@khmer> tacitly, the foreman feels his brother's mounting disgust with his lack of preparation. he knew this was a food warehouse. he knew there would be refrigeration. but it had slipped his mind.
<@khmer> every moment, every motion feels like a cringe. he loves his brother and is grateful for the second chance, but he doesn't have the words
<@khmer> he was taught not to use the words
<@khmer> he was taught to turn up the television or to leave and go buy mom a pack of dunhills
<@khmer> his brother got all the luck anyway, all of the good fortune and all of the second chances
<@khmer> and despite his mother's blatant favoritism, his congenital scoliosis, the chain of foolish devotions to soulless women, the learning disability
<@khmer> he still found himself feeling ashamed, though he had accomplished more in a material sense than his brother--the precise kind of sense that all his loved ones told him was the only sense that matters
<@khmer> his emotions collapse into themselves, their complex miasma balling up into a black shame
<@khmer> he forgets that his brother might love him, and knows in the bleak center of it all that he must go through the motions
<@khmer> the elevator inches lower, passing by the refrigeration unit
<@khmer> the elevator operator looks at the new foreman, at his image in the wrecked spirit, at his blood in the dust
<@khmer> the silence of longing and voiceless love and anger and fear and regret
<@khmer> he can think of nothing to say about the refrigeration unit, but knows that his brother is expecting comment, and he would do anything to escape the deafening silence
<@khmer> the silence of longing and voiceless love and anger and fear and regret
<@khmer> so as the blast of icy air relents, over the creak of the elevator, he says
<@khmer> "cool story, bro."

< Kliment> I was biking at an unwise speed today and flew past an election ad.
< Kliment> I only caught a glimpse of it due to the speed, and it said something like "Europe for Jesus" and the date of the election.
< Kliment> Made me think of how sad and unconvincing the election ads are this year.
< Kliment> That in turn made me think of the swedes here telling about voting.
< Kliment> That made me think about voting incentives.
< Kliment> That made me think about a certain sex store in the US giving out vibrators to anyone that voted.
< Kliment> That made me think about how this was unnecessary in the US, where it was very tight and high turnout anyway.
< Kliment> That made me think about the candidates that didn't make it.
< Kliment> Specifically Ron Paul, which made me think of Randall's story about Ron Paul and the Chamber of Commerce
< Kliment> Which made me thiink of someone who would have voted Ron Paul, who runs a private school in Bulgaria.
< Kliment> Which made me think about how private schools often have very fancy names.
< Kliment> So I thought about how many "academies" I knew.
< Kliment> And that made me think about mac training courses being named macademy.
< Kliment> And then I came up with a pun about how to call apple fans in research universities.
< Kliment> Macademia nuts.
< Kliment> This is all.
< Kliment> This all happened within 600m or so, at high speed.

*valravn wonders if bitcoin mining is an effective way of heating a room.
<neoinr> You lose money on power with bitcoin mining on most machines these days, but possibly not more than you'd gain from using it as a heater.
<snark> Heaters must be the most efficient appliances.
<snark> I mean, it's not like they're losing waste energy as heat.

< XMPPwocky> .... I've been modelling a bus arbiter using my cat
< XMPPwocky> front paws are REQ lines, back paws are ACK lines
< XMPPwocky> my cat doesn't seem to like it
< XMPPwocky> and, of course, tail as BUSY
< XMPPwocky> the nice thing about cats is that they effectively come in a very large DIP package
< XMPPwocky> and they have built in wire strippers
< XMPPwocky> not to be confused with actual strippers, as these are teeth
< XMPPwocky> the interface, however, is decidedly unintuitive
< XMPPwocky> and there is somewhat of a noise issue
< XMPPwocky> however, the latter can be beneficial- a properly working device will emit a low purr, while a failed device will make a screeching noise
< XMPPwocky> the part is also very well insulated
< XMPPwocky> and has a built in thermal generator for operation under a wide range of temperatures
< XMPPwocky> however, it is very difficult to solder
< XMPPwocky> The component contains automatic overcurrent protection; in the event of excess current being drawn, the part will remove itself from the circuit and hide under your couch
< XMPPwocky> the overheating protection operates in a similar manner.
< XMPPwocky> this will also trigger the screeching noise.
< XMPPwocky> The part must be kept well-ventilated, and well-fed.

<Caffeine> Mindhack: Think blackboard.       Think chalk.       Think *sckreeeeeeeeeeeeeech*
<@snark> Caffeine: saying "think blackboard think chalk think screech" in no way activates my imagination
<@snark> Caffeine: you could use a story, maybe. People love stories and know exactly what to do when they start hearing one. "There I was, immersed in the boring task of writing lines on the blackboard, chalk in hand, getting it all over my fingers, the smell of it in the room, when something caught my eye. There was something on the floor, in the corner of the room.
<@snark> I stopped, mid-yawn from my boring task, and took a step towards the object, when my foot caught and BAM, I slammed teeth first into the blackboard. Screeeech all the way down."
<Joker> Owwww
<@snark> I'm just saying, you need to get someone to be actually using their imagination before you can exploit it. Gotta boot up the system first.
<@snark> Caffeine: see, it worked :)
<Joker> :(
<Caffeine> snark: I based the hack off a previously successful attempt
<@snark> oh well
<Axalto> Guys, have you ever just stopped whatever you are doing,
<Axalto> looked around
<Axalto> and thought to yourself, "man, humanity is pretty freaking weird"
<Axalto> weird yet awesome
<Axalto> think about it, you're right now using a machine to chat with people all over the world
<Axalto> with a latency of at max a second
<Axalto> and we all accept it as normal or even "old technology"
<Axalto> think about a cell
<Axalto> go to the wikipedia page of it
<Axalto> and then realize you have millions of them
<Axalto> all those cells, little factories are constantly working at near-perfect efficiency
<@snark> think about a blackboard. Think about how crazy it is that we make marks on it with bits of powdery white rock. Think about that experience, writing on the blackboard. It's amazing to imagine that sound when it all goes horribly wrong.
<Caffeine> snark: i see what you did there
<acegiak> I can comprehend a tree, and go "holy fuck am I on some alien planet? there are these organisms that filter both the atmposhere and the geosphere not only causing themselves to continue but to also support massive amounts of ecosystem"
<@snark> acegiak: I just think it's amazing that we can punch trees until they break, and then make tools out of the wood.
<Axalto> snark, you're not thinking on an atomic level enough
<Axalto> think of how the atoms themselves interact to make matter and everything possible
<@snark> think of how many things that don't matter are made out of stuff that is matter
<Axalto> ha!
<Caffeine> Axalto: Think of the sun. It warms us, gives us the premise for life. And all of this while being millions of kilometers away. And that's only from tiny particles of mass crashing into each other and fusing; particles we can't even see
<acegiak> snark, have you ever stopped and thought about creepers? That natural selection could favour an organism that explodes with very little threat in order to protect those with similar but not directly related genetics?"
<Caffeine> sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
<@snark> Atoms are crazy. Picture for a moment a group of atoms playing a game of pool with an electron. The room is smoky, and the electron huddles in the center of the table, staring up against the glare of the lamp above. Imagine the furrowed eyebrows and concentration as the leader of the atom gang tongues his stogie to the other side of his mouth and lines up a shot. There's no metaphor here, but wouldn't that be crazy?
<Axalto> think of how we can just create a full virtual world for free with map editing tools
<Axalto> CPUs are awesome
<Axalto> GPUs are even more awesome
<@snark> Think about how we can create a map out of the real world with nothing but paper, formed from woodpulp, and crayons, formed from rainbows and earwax
<@snark> Think of all the tiny numbers bouncing around inside your computer. Where do they come from? Where do they go when we delete them? We just don't know.
<Axalto> Actually yes we do
<@snark> Don't spoil the wonder of the universe man. Once you spoil that it will never come back. It is gone forever. Look what you did.
<@snark> Apologize to that CPU.
<@snark> I fear not that we shall ever run out of wonders, but that we may one day run out of wonder. And it will be all your fault because you think we can explain where integers go when they die.
<Caffeine> Axalto: Allow me to jump from your microscopic view to macro; we're one planet. Everything we humans have done, all our history, all our discoveries. All our wars, all our suffering, all our politics. Every word ever said, every keystroke ever tapped has happened inside of this tiny insignificant sphere of air and metal and dust. Close to everything we know. All in this tiny little place. Our world. Our entire existence. One planet among ...
<Caffeine> ... billions in our galaxy, one galaxy among millions. If there is just one other sentient world out there, it's more to comprehend than what is humanly possible. One world would make so much difference; making our world and all our knowledge and events. Our existence. Just one among others. Insignificant.
<Caffeine> And that makes me feel very alone
<@snark> Don't feel alone because the universe is vast and empty and all we've ever known to exist is within the bounds of a dust mote floating in the infinite void. Feel alone because you're sitting around discussing this on IRC.
<Caffeine> I love the mountains... I love the clear blue sky. I love our tiny sphere. It is everywhere. I love the whole 'verse, and all it's sights and stuff...
<@snark> your ex told me about your tiny spheres
<Caffeine> snark: Well that's well and all, I don't have an ex
<@snark> your why then.
<@snark> I heard about it from the philosophy of the endless collective unconscious, the whys and wherefores of which are shared by all. It told me that our sphere is tiny, as are all the spheres against the stage of space.
<@snark> that's your why, I guess.

<%Chiba> I'm all 'curse you wiki you LIED'
<%Chiba> ...then I see a thief run past and all the guards go right past me after him
<%Chiba> and I'm like 'oh uh right YES AFTER HIM *skulks off into the shadows*'

<ftr> aaaaahhhhhhhhhh
<Vossy> you can tune a guitar, but you can't tuna fish

<ftr> creature: what for?

<ftr> AAAHHHHHHHHH

<J> he's just going to tune us out
<ftr> i swear to god im going to be rocking back and forth in my chair
<Deadpool> rocking one way or the other...
<J> I'm sorry. I'll try to be more chordial from now on.
* ftr goes foetal in the corner and whimpers
<Deadpool> c'mon, we're just trying to touch bass with you
<Vossy> ftr: wake up and face the music
<Frowardd> we're not trying to picka fight
<J> These puns have really changed the tenor of the conversation.
<ftr> seriously, how fucking long can you sad sacks keep this up for
<Frowardd> let's throw it into overdrive
<J> To make puns for this long, you have to b sharp.
<ftr> don't distort the lines
* ftr slaps himself
<Frowardd> you know ftr, it could be worse
<Dark-Fx> I can keep it up as long as I choir to.
<J> Probably only another minuet or two
<Dark-Fx> ftr is being quite percussive
<Deadpool> well, at least we're getting feedback.
<J> Music puns are our forte, it turns out
<Vossy> Ah, but one must be careful not to overplay them
<J> Yeah. We want to stay composed.
<Deadpool> they can get overamped.
<Frowardd> we are conducting ourselves admirably
<Vossy> it's easy to become lost in the music
<Deadpool> We should make sure to be well orchestrated
<J> If only there were some tonic that ftr could take to stop this
<Vossy> Ah, that tonic will not come forth, for it is sub-dominant to our puns :P
<ftr> there is. it goes well with gin. and it makes everything all blurry
<Deadpool> he could take notes.
<Deadpool> or play them
<ftr> oh thank god, ive never been so glad to need to restart my pc in all my life
<J> I guess we harped on it a bit too much
<AtomicCow> I think J is broken
<Deadpool> no no, j is fine.
<J> I'm OK -- this is just a prelude to the real punning.
<Deadpool> he's just getting himself in arrangement
<Dark-Fx> I don't think J thinks at the same tempo as the rest of us.
<J> No, alright, I'm done. These are starting to get a big symphoney.
<AtomicCow> do you black out and just output puns?
<J> You have to admit, though, some of those were suite.
<J> That's not true, you lyre!
<J> OK, I'm really done. Whew.
<Frowardd> that was a good run, fellas

* Rena doesn't know of any other country that uses Hiragana
<nazgjunk> 	Rena: not everyone has even the slightest clue how to distinguish between Chinese and Japanese >.>
<ellipsis> nazgjunk: Kanji looks crazy complicated, lots of lines. Hiragana has fewer curvy lines, and Katakana almost makes sense to look at
<Rena> yeah basically, if it looks like utter hell to write, it's Kanji (Chinese, but also used in Japanese). If it looks simple and has mostly curves, it's probably Hiragana (Japanese). If it looks simple and has mostly straight lines, it's Katakana (Japanese). If it looks like something you might see used as an "alien language" in a movie, it's Hangul (Korean).
<Rena> (not to offend the Koreans; it's actually a pretty cool writing system)
<chrisbrl88> klingon is easier to read than korean
<ellipsis> chrisbrl88: romanized klingon or the actual characters?
<chrisbrl88> ellipsis: the actual characters
<Rena> if it uses English characters, but writing it makes you want to go jump on a sword, it's C++. :-p
<Velociraptors> If it uses English characters but is still undecipherable, it's perl.

<TheMiNd> It has been decided that Thomas the Tank Engine is a veiled attempt at exposing children to communist ideals
<TheMiNd> Are you familiar with the show?
<ftr> TheMiNd: i am familiar with thomas the tank engine. why is it communist?
<TheMiNd> ftr: keep in mind that when you watch this crap over and over at work every day... it gets bad.
<TheMiNd> Anyway.  Two rich people on the island.  Sir Topham Hat and Mr. Percival.  They and the drivers control everything the engines do.
<TheMiNd> The majority of the Island of sodor's transportation and freight is via rail.  So the populace (and the engines) can only go where the ruling class allows them to.
<TheMiNd> Mr Percival, however, can go wherever he wants, because he has a bicycle. (and a guy that holds it for him when he's not riding)
<TheMiNd> The trains are brainwashed so that they are only happy when they are being "Really Useful" ... working.
<TheMiNd> They work all the time, getting no benefit from their labors.  Sir Topham hat gets all that benefit, and he lives in a castle
<TheMiNd> The trains are given tasks that encourage infighting amongst them, so that they can never unite against their oppressors.
<TheMiNd> The freight cars represent the Proletariat.  They are unable to move anywhere without an engines help, and usually try to cause trouble for the trains.
<TheMiNd> We were really bored.

<Boom_Farmer> Supernovae.
<PacifistDalek> Time Travel + Social engineering in order to get your recipient's neighbours surrounding him or her to be named by their parents the words of the message you wish to send
<Boom_Farmer> Multiple hydrogem bombs, carefully arranged around the planet and triggered so that, at the moment you wish the recipient to view the message, shockwaves from the blasts converge on his eardrums, forming the audio of a message he will not live to understand.
<PacifistDalek> Genetically engineer a bacterial culture that infects a person and causes them to have auditory hallucinations of the desired message
<PacifistDalek> Inject the bacteria into a dozen monkeys
<PacifistDalek> break into the recipient's co-workers' houses and hide the monkeys there, but not before giving the monkeys a feast of taco bell food
<PacifistDalek> Then, buy out the recipient's work and install yourself as CEO
<PacifistDalek> Remove all sick hours due to "A Very Important Project"
<PacifistDalek> thus have the recipient sit in their cubicle doing work while his co-workers slowly go insane around him, mumlbing the message as they collapse in spasms of projectile vomiting
<Boom_Farmer> Use a mirror array at the L4 and l5 points to burn your message onto the road in front of them as they drive.
<Boom_Farmer> Your plan is just sick.
<PacifistDalek> Why thank you! *bows*
<PacifistDalek> That's what I get for trying to one-up hydrogen bombs
<Boom_Farmer> Release a grey-goo nanomachine that aggressively devours Earth, uploading scans of the Earth into a goo-based simulator, in which two-deep simulation of the Matrix universe is simulated, with a 1990s Earth being simulated by evil robot overlords living in a 2100s post--apocalyptic universe. Your target lives and works in the 1990s, until one day he recieves a message from his computer that he should follow the white rabbit. 
<Boom_Farmer> Morpheus delivers the message to your target once your target has entered the 2100s.
<Boom_Farmer> At this point, your target realizes that the 2100s are also a simulation, and uses statistical analysis of randomness to determine to construction of the nanobots running the 2100s. He creates a mathematical algorithm that, when read back by any nanomachine, causes the nanomachines to reverse their computational process, effectively rebuilding Earth.
<Boom_Farmer> Then the nanobots all die.
