{"name":"The Red Spider Project","tagline":"Coding and xkcd combined, for fun!","body":"### Wait, what?\r\n\r\nEssentially we're writing a heterogenous set of (small, portable, amusing/interesting/touching, possibly interacting, command-line) programs, which may expand continually. We're not working towards a final goal, just enjoying the process. We're open to ideas, programming languages and people. If you like coding and [xkcd](http://xkcd.com) too, please consider joining the project!\r\n\r\n### Pointers\r\n\r\nIn case you're full of questions, we have a [Readme](https://github.com/the-xkcd-community/the-red-spider-project/blob/master/Readme.md) and a [wiki](https://github.com/the-xkcd-community/the-red-spider-project/wiki). If you wonder who we are or want to introduce yourself or your idea, check out [our thread at the xkcd forums](http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=81969). We also have an IRC channel: [#redspider at foonetic.net](irc://irc.foonetic.net/redspider). If you want to help out, please have a look at our [issues](https://github.com/the-xkcd-community/the-red-spider-project/issues).\r\n\r\n### Artwork\r\n\r\n![our logo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3512486/spider-noodle.png)\r\n\r\nJoey (aka tidbit) designed our splendid logo.
