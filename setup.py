Initial setup script for the Red Spider Project

Note: some of the program logic can be made more elegant if we make it
os.chdir(red_spider_root) soon after verify_root().

A -q option to make it less verbous would probably be nice. Until we have a
dedicated 'update' command we'll need to run the setup every time one of the
commands has been changed on master.
