Platforms

### Target platforms ###

Anything on branch `master` should be stable and support at least the
following platforms:

 -  Windows with cmd.exe (tested on Windows 7);
 -  Mac OS X with bash (tested on 10.6);
 -  Linux with bash (tested on Fedora 16).

Exceptions are possible, please discuss such cases with the others.

Other platforms might work too, we just don't take effort to ensure
that. For example PowerShell on Windows works, though inconveniently.
If you want to use Bash on Windows (for example Git Bash), you'll have
to add tools like `python` to your PATH.

More platform support can be added if testers are available. Let us
know if you want to test for a new platform.
