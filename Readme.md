The Red Spider Project
----------------------

[http://the-xkcd-community.github.com/the-red-spider-project]


### Why ###

Because we like to combine our love for the xkcd comic with our love
for coding, and we want to share the experience.


### How ###

By keeping an ongoing project to which people can add programs at
will. By "program", we mean *any* program. It may be any size and it
may be written in any programming language, though preferably
portable. Most of the programs in our project will probably be
amusing, interesting, touching or a combination of those, either
because of the source code, because of the output, or both. Likely,
most programs will also be small. Anything is welcome except malware.

We put some emphasis on command line programs. The programs may be
interconnected with basic plumbing. We'll put some guidelines and
infrastructure in place to keep things smooth, as we see the need.
Other than that, it's basically liberty above all things!


### What ###



### When ###

We started in March 2012. In the first few months we spent most of our
effort on the infrastructure. In July we were treated to some splendid
logo designs and we got a homepage. In December we launched our IRC
channel. In the meanwhile several members have been working on various
subprojects, mostly in short bursts of activity.

In the near future we may expect wiki content, a few big improvements
to the infrastructure, and an overarching role playing game, among
other things.


### Who ###

Julian coined the idea, qubital set up the GitHub repository, Neil
wrote most of the initial infrastructure code and Joey designed the
logo proposals. Please also refer to the copyright notices in the

decided not to add their name to some file they edited.
